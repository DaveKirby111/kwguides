    <h5>Saif Manufacturing Plant</h5>
    <p>
      After riding the elevator down in the Sarif Manufacturing Facility to the
      hallway with the turret, there is a Praxis Kit in plain sight as you
      trigger the Augmentation video tutorial.
    </p>

        LIMB Clinic purchase (Y-5ooo). Be sure to buy both units before
        proceeding to Heng Sha (or earlier to FEMA).

        Locate the Purity First / Humanity Front terrorist staging room in
        Tindall's and O'Malley's apartment building (the one building with the
        locked gate). You can locate the passcode to this Level 5 door from a
        pocket secretary in an alley by the police station -- or, if you have
        the ammunition and explosives, just destroy the door with weapons fire
        -- if you cannot hack the door's lock. The storage cage (3663) has a
        Praxis Kit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Derelict Row Banger (DRB) territory sewers. There is a DRB sewer
        checkpoint (crewed by three gangsters) near the ladder to the weapons
        cache (Jenny Alexander's side mission). There's a break-able wall past
        this DRB guard station, which is highlighted prominently if you have the
        Wall Punch augmentation. The Praxis Kit is in the secret room hidden by
        that break-able wall.

        Lower Heng Sha Court Gardens area. It is the elevator shaft of the
        building where the Dutchman hacker was staying, but the enemy PMC is
        currently raiding. The only way into the shaft (e.g., not using the
        elevator) is to locate the place where you may punch a wall near the
        Heng Sha Court rooftops. The Praxis Kit is under the last ladder at the
        very bottom of this elevator shaft. As a bonus, you can get to the
        Dutchman's apartment (or Jaya's place) via a vent from this shaft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower Heng Sha sewers (same map as the Hotel Hung Hua and The Hive).
        Locate the Hotel Hung Hua (Red Flower) and locate the weapons dealer on
        its first floor. Past the dealer is a ladder to the sewer. There is a
        breakable wall in the sewer passage near this ladder with the Praxis
        Kit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the side mission for Faridah Malik in regards to the murder by
        accident by "My father is Lee Gang!" Lee. You do not need to gather all
        the evidence (although it helps with the Super Sleuth
        achievement/trophy). Upon completing the side mission for Malik, she
        will give you this Praxis Kit outside The Hive nightclub.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the side mission for Bobby Bao. This assumes you managed to
        convince Tong Si Hung to peacefully meet with Adam in the basement of
        The Hive nightclub. If you didn't, you may have some trouble getting the
        dialogue thread for Bao to trust Jensen. Locate Bao's target, Jaya, in
        the apartment building where you found traces of the Dutchman hacker and
        handle the problem. For the ultimate reward (Praxis Kit), you should
        meet the Guardian Angel criteria and buy Jaya's ass back for Y-5ooo.
        When you speak with Bobby Bao once more, you will receive a Praxis Kit
        as payment.
      </li>

    <h5>tai yung medical</h5>

      TYM laboratory (the first restricted area room). Check the second level's
      two labs/offices in the south. The eastern room has this Praxis Kit in a
      desk drawer.
    </p>

    <h5>picus broadcasting tower</h5>

    <p>
      When you first arrive at Picus, try to avoid triggering enemies by going
      to room 404. Visit the lower news-pit (central area with all the
      journalists' desks) and one of the desk drawers will have a Praxis Kit.

        This Praxis Kit only appears if you allowed Zeke Sanders to live in the
        Sarif Manufacturing Plant. Dr. Sandoval's apartment has a Praxis Kit,
        but it is booby trapped by Zeke. This ass-hat will ambush you with two
        EMP mines in the apartment. If you have an improved radar or enhanced
        vision, you will know where Zeke is in the room. Take him out first,
        then take the Praxis Kit. For this extra trouble, you also get two
        unspent EMP mines.

    <h5>Heng Sha Revisited</h5>

    <p class="fw-bold">
      Word of warning -- if you decide to update Adam's bio-chip, you will have
      an extremely tough time with the next few bosses. Make like a Russian and
      stick to what works.

        At the LIMB Clinic in Heng Sha, locate a Dr. Hui Wing. He will give you
        the Talion A.D. side mission about Michael Zelazny. Resolve the side
        mission and Dr. Wing will hand over a Praxis Kit.
